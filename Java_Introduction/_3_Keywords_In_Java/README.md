# Keywords in Java
Keywords in Java are reserved words that have a predefined meaning and cannot be used as variable names, class names, or method names. They are an essential part of the Java programming language and provide a standardized way to write code that can be easily understood by other developers. In this readme, we will cover the most common keywords in Java.

## Access Modifiers
Access modifiers determine the visibility and accessibility of a class, method, or variable. The four access modifiers in Java are:

public: The public keyword makes a class, method, or variable accessible from anywhere in the program.
private: The private keyword makes a class, method, or variable accessible only within the same class.
protected: The protected keyword makes a class, method, or variable accessible within the same class and its subclasses.
default (no modifier): The default keyword makes a class, method, or variable accessible within the same package.

## Control Flow Keywords
Control flow keywords are used to control the flow of execution in a program. The most common control flow keywords in Java are:

if/else: Used for conditional statements. The code inside the "if" block will be executed if the condition is true, and the code inside the "else" block will be executed if the condition is false.
for: Used for loops. The code inside the "for" block will be executed a specified number of times.
while: Used for loops. The code inside the "while" block will be executed as long as the condition is true.
do/while: Used for loops. The code inside the "do" block will be executed at least once, and then the condition will be checked. If the condition is true, the code inside the "while" block will be executed again.
switch/case: Used for multi-way branching. The code inside the "case" block will be executed if the value matches the specified value in the "switch" statement.

## Other Common Keywords
Here are some other common keywords in Java:

class: Used to define a class.
static: Used to define a variable or method that belongs to the class instead of an instance of the class.
final: Used to define a variable or method that cannot be changed.
void: Used to indicate that a method does not return a value.
new: Used to create a new instance of a class.
this: Used to refer to the current object.
super: Used to refer to the parent class.

## Conclusion
Keywords are an important part of the Java programming language. By using keywords in your code, you can ensure that it is easily understood by other developers and that it follows the established conventions of the language. The access modifiers, control flow keywords, and other common keywords we covered in this readme are just a few examples of the many keywords available in Java.
